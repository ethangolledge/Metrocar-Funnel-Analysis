## Project Summary

### About Metrocar
Metrocar connects riders with drivers through a mobile app, acting as an intermediary to facilitate ride-hailing.

### Funnel Analysis
Our analysis of Metrocarâ€™s customer funnel identified key areas for improvement:

* Ride Completion: Only 50.8% of users complete a ride after acceptance.
* Request Acceptance: 64.4% of ride requests are accepted.

### Key Areas of Focus
* Platform: iOS is our primary platform; marketing should target iOS users.
* Demographic Target: The 35-44 age group is our most valuable demographic.
* Surge Pricing: Consider implementing surge pricing from 8am-9am and 4pm-7pm.

### Analytical Tools
* Data Exploration: SQL in Beekeeper
* Detailed Analysis: Python
* Visualisation: Tableau

### Data Sources
We used five Postgres tables, covering app_downloads, signups, ride_requests, transactions, and reviews.

### Conclusion
The analysis highlights significant areas of user and ride drop-off. Further research is needed to develop strategies for improvement.
